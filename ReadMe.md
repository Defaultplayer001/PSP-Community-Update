For all PSP models! (Personally tested on 1k, 2k, and 3k models.)

Do at your own risk! 

A more mature and model specific, if obtuse and unnecessarily complex guide in need of updating is available here. https://hackinformer.com/PlayStationGuide/PSP/DEVICE_PSP.html 

If you want *permanent* CFW I'd recommend using that! 

This guide and package is an extrapolation of it's 6.61 LME 3k 03g instructions.

Preserved below for posterity and for users wanting just the minimum / simplest, or for 32mb Memory Stick users. (Hyperlinks pasted into plain text)



1) Download and install the latest Official Firmware 6.61 (Go! Version) if you haven't already

6.61 FW: http://du01.psp.update.playstation.org/update/psp/image/us/2014_1212_6be8878f475ac5b1a499b95ab2f7d301/EBOOT.PBP

Go! Version:

2) Download the 6.61 LME-2.3 Custom Firmware and extract the ZIP-Archive

http://www.mediafire.com/file/y0yzmy1iu3av541/release_661lme2.3.zip/file

3) Copy the "installer" and "launcher" folder to your "PSP/GAME/" directory

4) Launch the "LME Installer for 661" from the XMB and install the CFW

5) To activate your CFW run the "LME Launcher for 661" from the XMB

If you want easy / safe but "temporary" CFW, this guide should help! (Again, at your own risk! Do your own research and ask around before trusting any single source with your hardware and software!)

Instructions

1. Copy contents over to the root of your memory stick. 

2. Insert memory stick, update to 6.61 if you haven't already. Go to Games\Memory Stick\Update to 6.61 and launch! 

3. Go to Games\Memory Stick\LME Installer and launch! Follow the prompt and install. 

After it reboots, just go into your games and run the silver "Launch LME" Icon to go into CFW! 
You may also delete the 6.61 update and LME Installer. (Press triangle to access the option)

If your PSP ever completely shuts off, you will have to launch again to activate your CFW. 

-----

Optionally, you may instally Lightspeed for a more convienant CFW launcher. Replacing the Digital Comics or SenseMe apps. (I recommend Digital Comics)

1. Simply find and launch the Lightspeed icon under games, the same way you did the LME installer and launcher.

2. Follow the prompts and choose between replacing Digital Comics or SenseMe.

After the install is done, you can delete Lightspeed the same way as the installer.

Useful tips: 

1. Hold R when launching a PSX game to select the emulator version you want to use via Popsloader.

2. For PSX games, use pad Type 4 if you want the default layout but with the joystick used for movement. Not selected for all games by default because I find the d-pad more comfortable / retro. That and doing that 35 times would be tedious.

3. Press select 4 times when the keyboard comes up to change to a saner layout. (Not available in all games for some reason)

4. Don't leave UMDs out in the open, unlike floppies they don't have a door and dirt / dust can get inside and grind them down while reading. Good to leave them in a case or baggie.

A few useful tools are included under the TOOL folder.

Tools:
-
6.61 Update (Latest Official Update)
PSP Video Converter (Custom HQ PSP video converter script)
Digimon World Re-Digitize English Translation Patch (Use "Dub" setting for running on actual hardware, otherwise it crashes after inputting a name. Included for archival reasons, relatively hard to track down)
Full PSX1 Boot Plugin
ISO Compression Tool (PSP ISO Compressor 1.4, Saves space at performance cost) 
Modding Tool (release_661lme2.3, Used to install CFW)
PS1 Compatibility Tool (Popsloader_v4i, Let's you select Emulator Version)
PSP Stuck Pixel Fixer (Actually under VIDEO, just a video. Run on repeat for an extended period of time)

To do: Include a bare-minimum guide based on that other guide. Also recommend that for 32mb users. b
